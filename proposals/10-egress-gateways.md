# Egress Gateways

* Status: Proposed

# What?

Provide standards in Kubernetes to route traffic outside of the cluster.

# Why?

Applications are increasingly utilizing inference as a part of their logic.
This may be for chatbots, knowledgebases, or a variety of other potential use
cases. The inference workloads to support this may not always be on the same
cluster as the requesting workload. Inference workloads may be on a separate
cluster, as the organization centralizes them, or they may be located
specifically for reasons of regionality. Even then, not all organizations are
going to run inference workloads themselves, and will utilize 3rd party cloud
services. All of this points to a need to provide standards for how Kubernetes
workloads reach these external inference sources, and provide the same AI
Gateway security, control and management capabilities that are required for the
ingress use case.

## User Stories

* As a gateway admin I need to provide workloads within my cluster access to
  services outside of my cluster, in particular cloud and otherwise hosted
  services.

* As a gateway admin I need to manage access tokens for 3rd party AI services
  so that workloads on the cluster can perform inference within needing to
  manage these secrets themselves, and so that I can manage access from all
  workloads in a uniform manner.

* As a gateway admin providing access and token management for 3rd party AI
  cloud services to workloads, I need fail-over from one cloud provider to
  others when the primary cloud provider is overwhelmed or in a failure state.

* As a gateway admin providing egress routing to external services, I need
  to be able to verify the identity of that external source and enforce
  authentication to secure that connection.

* As a gateway admin providing egress routing to external services, I need
  to be able to verify the client connection to the external service.

* As a gateway admin providing egress routing to external services, I need
  to be able to manage certificate authorities for egress connections, such
  that I can pin certificates or provide custom authorities (e.g.
  intermediate, self-signed, etc). I should also be able to integrate
  Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to untrust revoked certificates.

* As a gateway admin providing egress routing to external service, DNS
  resolution for these sources needs to be controlled and secured. I need to
  be able to fine-tune control the DNS resolution of remote FQDNs including
  the ability to enable reverse DNS mapping checks.

* As a cluster admin I need to provide inference to workloads on my cluster,
  but I provide a dedicated cluster for this so that I can manage it
  separately.

* As a cluster admin I need to provide inference to workloads on my cluster,
  but I do not run AI workloads on Kubernetes. I use a cloud service to run
  models (e.g. Vertex, Bedrock) and need workloads to have managed access to
  that service to perform inference.

* As a developer of an application that requires inference as part of its
  function, I need my application to have access to external AI cloud services
  which offer specific, specialized features only offered by that provider.

* As a developer of an application that requires inference as part of its
  function, I need fail-over to 3rd party providers if local AI workloads are
  overwhelmed or in a failure state.

* As a platform operator I need to attribute outbound traffic per namespace or
  workload to enforce rate or API utilization limits.

* As a compliance engineer I need to guarantee that outbound traffic to
  third-party AI resources obeys regulatory restrictions such as region locks.

## Goals

* Define the standards for Gateways that route and manage traffic destined for
  external resources outside of the cluster.
* Define (or refine) the standards by which token management for Gateways can
  be employed to enable access to backends that require auth.
* Foundationally the standards for egress Gateways should be based on standards
  based networking first, layering up to inference and agentic use cases.

# How?

## Overview

### Reverse-Proxy Egress Model

This proposal focuses on a reverse-proxy egress model, where destinations are explicitly configured. It aims to define:

1. Resource model using Gateway + HTTPRoute with an additional resource (e.g. `Backend`) for destinations (Service or FQDN).
2. Two routing modes: Endpoint (direct) and Parent (gateway chaining).
3. Policy scoping: Gateway (global posture), Route (filters, per-request), Backend (per-destination).
4. Extension points for AI use cases (payload processing, guardrails), without assuming an AI-only design.

#### Backend Placement

This proposal uses the following resource relationship:
```
Gateway <-[parentRef]- HTTPRoute -[backendRef]-> Backend
```
A `Backend` represents an external destination. Today, egress is typically achieved via a synthetic `Service`; this proposal instead uses `Backend` to represent that destination directly.

A `Service` does not need to know about a `Gateway`, and likewise this proposal does not attach `Backend` to a particular `Gateway`. A single `Backend` may be referenced by multiple `HTTPRoute` objects and consumed by multiple Gateways. In contrast, `HTTPRoute` does attach to specific Gateways via `parentRef`, since it represents configuration that is scoped to a particular Gateway.

### Out of Scope

Forward-proxy egress (dynamic routing to arbitrary external hostnames), network-level egress (L3/L4 CIDR-based routing), and mesh-attached egress (sidecar-enforced policy without a Gateway) are not covered by this proposal. Each may be explored in a follow-up GEP.

## Open Design Questions

### Gateway Resource

**Preferred Approach: Reuse Gateway API Gateway**
- Leverage existing `Gateway`, `HTTPRoute`, and `GRPCRoute` resources
- HTTPRoute references to external backends make it an egress gateway
- Requires Backend resource to represent external destinations

**Alternative Considered: New EgressGateway Resource**
- Introduce dedicated `EgressGateway` resource type
- Enables egress-specific fields (e.g., global CIDR allow-lists) without policy attachment overhead
- Clearer separation of ingress vs egress concerns

**Cons**
- Implies defining equivalents of parentRefs, listeners, and route attachment.

This proposal focuses on the `Gateway`, `Route` and `Backend` model for egress, but MUST NOT preclude mesh-based egress models in future work.

### Backend Resource and Policy Application

`Backend`s provide a first-class way to describe external destinations (for example, FQDNs) and the connection policy needed to reach them.

Implementations MAY also allow Backends to reference additional egress-related extensions for concerns such as credential injection or QoS,
but the detailed semantics of those extensions are out of scope for this proposal.


```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backend
metadata:
  name: openai-backend
spec:
  destination:
    type: FQDN
    fqdn:
      hostname: api.openai.com
    ports:
    - number: 443
      protocol: TLS
      tls:
        mode: None | Simple | Mutual
        sni: api.openai.com
        caBundleRef:
          name: vendor-ca
  extensions:
  - name: inject-credentials
    type: gateway.networking.k8s.io/CredentialInjector:v1
    phase: request-headers
    priority: 10
    failOpen: false
    config:
      secretRef:
        name: openai-api-key
        namespace: platform-secrets
```

#### Producer vs. Consumer Role

In the context of egress routing, the `Backend` resource always represents the **consumer** side of the connection. Regardless of whether or not the `Backend` is defined in the same namespace as the route sending traffic to it (or the Gateway hosting that route), the `Backend` describes how the client (i.e. the egress gateway) should connect to a service outside of the cluster. Therefore, it's a consumer resource.

There is, however, an open question about what the appropriate role for `Backend`s of type `KubernetesService`. If a `Backend` points to a Service within the same cluster, is it still a consumer resource (describing how the gateway should connect to that Service), or is it a producer resource (describing how the Service expects clients to connect to it)? This question is important because it influences how we think about policy application and ownership semantics for `Backend`s. I propose that we treat all `Backend`s as consumer resources for the sake of consistency and simplicity. This means that even if a `Backend` points to a `Service` within its same namespace, it still describes how the gateway should connect to that Service from a client perspective. This approach has the added benefit of allowing different namespaces to define their own `Backend` resources for the same Service, each with potentially different connection policies (e.g. TLS settings, extensions) without ReferenceGrant. This aligns with the idea that different consumers may have different requirements for how they connect to the same service.

One consequence of this approach is that `Backend` is not a suitable target for any producer-side policies (e.g. authorization or authentication). This is difficult to enforce at the API level ([GEP-713](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-713/) for policy attachment does not specify categories distinguishing producer vs consumer), so implementations MUST consider `Backend` only as a consumer when attaching policies to it. Note that this does not preclude the possibility of defining egress authorization policies (e.g. consumer X can only talk to services A and B) if (and only if!) the implementation can guarantee enforcement. Most implementations should likely be setting producer-side authorization/authentication policy at the egress gateway instead.


#### TLS Policy

The example above inlines a basic TLS configuration directly on the `Backend` resource. This is intentional.
Gateway API’s existing `BackendTLSPolicy` is designed around Service-based backends only and may end up being too restrictive for our needs. More specifically, using it for egress today would require representing each external FQDN as a synthetic Service, which this proposal aims to avoid. Furthermore, one could argue that inlined TLS policy provides simpler UX, especially in egress use-cases. `BackendTLSPolicy` also doesn't allow setting client certificates per backend; only once at `Gateway.spec.tls.backend`. This is overly restrictive for external FQDNs; no one "owns" a particular FQDN and can speak authoritatively about how every service in the cluster should talk to it. Generally speaking, the TLS field within `Backend` is meant to describe the TLS configuration that a client should use when talking to a backend. As the `Backend` resource shape stabilizes, we SHOULD evaluate whether `BackendTLSPolicy` can be reused, extended, or aligned for external FQDN egress use cases.

##### A note on the evolution of TLS within Gateway API

Today, the TLS story in Gateway API is [fractured](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/tls/):
- `Gateway.spec.listeners[].tls` defines general TLS settings for incoming connections (Standard)
  - Defines how to handle all TLS traffic to that listener(e.g. terminate it, pass it through)
- `Gateway.spec.tls` defines mTLS settings for the entire Gateway (Experimental)
  - the `backend` field describes how the Gateway should connect to backends
    - Specifically, it allows setting client certificates for mutual TLS
  - the `frontend` field allows defining the validation context that should be used for incoming connections
    - Used to validate the client certificate in mTLS scenarios
- `TLSRoute` allows users to specify how TLS should be handled on a per-route basis (Experimental)
  - Most useful for SNI-based routing in passthrough scenarios
- `BackendTLSPolicy` allows users to define TLS settings when connecting to backends (Standard)
  - Specifically, validation context for the server certificates presented by upstream backends.
  - Allows setting SNI for backend connections.
  - Allows defining SANs.

Note: more discussion on many of these fields can be found in [GEP 2907](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-2907/)

The proposed `Backend` resource introduces yet another place to define TLS settings, and there is certainly a cost to further fragmenting the TLS story. At minimum, I believe an additional configuration point is needed for the egress gateway story simply because there is no standard egress story in Kubernetes. `Service` type `ExternalName` is the closest analogue, however, many organizations shy away from it completely due to cross-namespace security risks. Furthermore, naive usage of `ExternalName` can easily break SNI and TLS because the HTTP Host/:authority header will point to the cluster-internal FQDN rather than the external hostname. Clients would have to manually override the Host header and SNI or (or try to use `BackendTLSPolicy` to set SNI but I think you still have the Host header problem). The `Backend` resource allows us to define a clear and unambiguous way to represent external FQDNs and how to connect to them securely.

Things get murkier for `Backend`s of type `KubernetesService`. Despite the reasons for inline policy mentioned above, there is a strong argument for reusing `BackendTLSPolicy` here to avoid duplication and user confusion. Perhaps there should be a separate resource for `ExternalFQDN` backends that allows inline TLS, while `KubernetesService` backends reuse `BackendTLSPolicy`? Or maybe there should be another field within backend to mark a destination as being external (regardless of whether it's an FQDN or an IP)? We should certainly revisit those alternatives if we hit a wall in pursuing the current direction. In the interest of exploring this proposal fully and the cohesiveness of TLS within Gateway APi as a whole, I propoes the following guidelines for TLS policy:

1. `Gateway.spec.listeners[].tls` remains the source of truth for incoming TLS connections to the Gateway.
2. `Gateway.spec.tls.backend` is removed in favor of the `Backend` resource's TLS field
    1. `Gateway.spec.tls.frontend` remains for gateway-wide mTLS validation of incoming connections.
3. `Backend` is explicitly disallowed as a targetRef for `BackendTLSPolicy`
4. We pursue aligning `BackendTLSPolicy` and `Backend.spec.tls` as closely as possible w.r.t types.
    1. There may be different semantics or defaults for different types of backends (FQDN vs Service) or resources (BackendTLSPolicy), but the shape should be as similar as possible to avoid user confusion.
    2. In the short term, if you don't need mTLS, users should prefer `BackendTLSPolicy` for Kubernetes services.
    3. We can revisit this recommendation as `Backend` and other decompositions of `Service` evolve.
5. `TLSRoute` retains its current role as the way to express per-route TLS handling (e.g. SNI routing in passthrough mode).

#### Backend Extensions

Backends MAY reference extension processors via `spec.extensions[]`. This proposal does **not** define processor semantics, catalogs, schema validation, or execution ordering. The details of those topics are covered in the separate **[Payload Processing proposal](../7-payload-processing.md)** and will be refined independently of the egress routing model.

__(Note: All examples of extensions in this document are illustrative only)__

#### Scope and Persona Ownership

`Backend` is a namespaced resource. This aligns with its role as a consumer resource: each namespace defines backends for the external destinations its workloads need to reach, potentially with different connection policies (TLS, extensions) for the same FQDN.

A cluster-scoped variant was considered. A single cluster-wide definition per destination would simplify policy enforcement and give platform operators a central point of control. However, it conflicts with the consumer-ownership model because e.g., different namespaces may have legitimate reasons to connect to the same destination with different certificates or extensions. Prior art from the Network Policy subproject (`AdminNetworkPolicy` vs `NetworkPolicy`) shows that both scopes can coexist; a cluster-scoped complement (e.g., `ClusterBackend`) may be explored in future work if admin use cases require it.

## Routing Modes

### Endpoint Mode
Client traffic flows through the egress gateway directly to an external endpoint (FQDN or IP). The gateway applies policies and routing logic before forwarding to the destination.

### Parent Mode
Client traffic flows through a local egress gateway to an upstream gateway before reaching the final endpoint. This enables gateway chaining for multi-cluster or multi-zone topologies. The local egress gateway treats the parent as a single upstream. Local retries are limited to establishing the parent connection. Request-level retries are performed by the parent.

Operators MUST use network policy or sidecar/egress proxy configuration to deny direct egress from workloads and force all outbound traffic to the Gateway.
Retry loops across gateways are prohibited; implementations MUST tag requests to prevent looped retries.

### Workload-to-Gateway Addressing

**Open Questions**

How do workloads in the cluster address and connect to the egress `Gateway`? Several approaches are under consideration and are **not** specified by this document:

- **Service-wrapped Gateway**: Wrap the `Gateway` in a `Service` to obtain a `.cluster.local` FQDN. This works today but requires a synthetic `Service`.
- **Direct Gateway addressing**: Allow `Gateway` resources to obtain `.cluster.local` addresses directly (would require decomposing some `Service` DNS capabilities).
- **Service as `HTTPRoute.parentRef`**: In mesh implementations, use a `Service` as a `parentRef` so traffic destined for that Service is transparently routed through a `Gateway`.
- **Simplified frontend resource**: A lighter-weight resource that maps `.cluster.local` FQDNs directly to `Backend` objects without requiring a full `Gateway` + `HTTPRoute` configuration.

Additionally, a `Backend` may be a suitable place to define failover priorities between endpoints, which `HTTPRoute` cannot currently express (it only supports weighted load balancing).

## Policy Application Scopes

Policies must be applicable at three levels:

1. **Gateway-level**: Global rules affecting all traffic (e.g., cluster-wide CIDR restrictions, denied model lists)
2. **Route-level**: Per-request logic via filters `HTTPRoute.rules[].filters[ExtensionRef]` (e.g., payload transforms, compliance checks)
3. **Backend-level**: credentials, TLS, DNS, rate/QoS via `Backend.extensions` or backend-targeted policies.

### Conflict Resolution
When multiple policies influence the same request:
- **Specificity precedence**: Route > Backend > Gateway.
- **Same-level ties**: Implementations MUST use a deterministic tie-break where the oldest resource (based on `metadata.creationTimestamp`) wins, and surface status indicating the conflict.

Implementations MUST apply this ordering to ensure consistent behavior.

## AI Workload Considerations

For inference and agentic workloads, the solution must support:

- **[Payload Processing](../7-payload-processing.md)**: Request/response transformations (PII redaction, prompt injection detection, content filtering)
  - note: Evaluation of payload processors occurs in the data plane; controllers reconcile objects into proxy configuration.
- **Protocol Support**: HTTP/gRPC for inference APIs, with future consideration for MCP and A2A protocols
- **Multi-destination Routing**: Failover between cloud providers and cross-cluster endpoints

## Observability Considerations

- Implementations MUST expose metrics tagged by `{gateway, route, backend, namespace, serviceAccount}` and surface conditions (e.g., `Accepted`, `Programmed`, `Degraded`).
- Denials and transform failures MUST emit Events.

## Service Mesh Considerations

Mesh-attached egress (where policy is enforced at the sidecar or waypoint proxy without a centralized Gateway) is out of scope for this proposal. A follow-up GEP may define how `Backend` interacts with mesh-based egress models.

## What about BackendTrafficPolicy?

Inlining TLS is discussed at length above, but a similar conversation should be had for the fields that current live in `BackendTrafficPolicy`, such as connection timeouts, retries, and load balancing. This is less pressing since `BackendTrafficPolicy` is still experimental, but we should decide whether or not we need both `BackendTrafficPolicy` and `Backend` or if we can consolidate them.

## Next Steps

1. Define Backend resource schema.
2. Specify default Backend policies e.g. CredentialInjector and QoSController.
3. Specify filter extension points for payload processing.
4. Align with multi-cluster and agentic networking proposals.
5. Prototype this design in at least one implementation to validate `Backend` vs `Route` vs Mesh placement and refine the API surface based on real-world usage.

# Additional Criteria

The following are things we need to resolve before we can consider this
proposal complete and ready to move out to other areas.

- [ ] We need to decide how the multi-cluster aspect of egress gateways
  interacts with the [GIE's multi-cluster proposal], if at all. This may end up
  with multiple different multi-cluster options for users, so we'll need to be
  clear about why there are multiple options, and what one solves over the
  other. SIG MC needs to be a part of this conversation.
- [ ] The Agentic Networking Subproject has a [proposal for external MCP/A2A]
  services, making them a stakeholder for egress gateways as well. We need to
  work with them to incorporate their user stories and requirements so that
  what we ultimately ship covers the combined use cases.

## Istio

Istio offers a centralized egress gateway in complement to direct egress from pods via a sidecar proxy.

### Centralized Egress Gateway

The dedicated Egress `Gateway` is framed as a mirror image of an ingress gateway, acting as a choke point for all traffic exiting a mesh.

> An ingress gateway allows you to define entry points into the mesh that all incoming traffic flows through. Egress gateway is a symmetrical concept; it defines exit points from the mesh. Egress gateways allow you to apply Istio features, for example, monitoring and route rules, to traffic exiting the mesh.

[source](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress/egress-gateway/)

### Direct Egress via Sidecar

Envoy sidecars send traffic directly to external services once those services are modeled in Istio's registry via `ServiceEntry`.

With respect to scoping, notably, `ServiceEntry` is namespace scoped, but visible by default to all namespaces.

> The ’exportTo’ field allows for control over the visibility of a service declaration to other namespaces in the mesh. By default, a service is exported to all namespaces.

### Ambient Mesh / Waypoint Proxy

Istio also offers the option to move policy enforcement out of sidecars and into a more centralized "Waypoint Proxy".

> Services can bind to a waypoint, and Istio will automatically send all traffic to those services through the waypoint.

Traffic to external services modeled via `ServiceEntry` can also be processed by a waypoint when associated with a namespace-level waypoint configuration.

This has the impact of centralizing policy enforcement at the namespace level for associated traffic, which can reduce complexity in namespace-centric deployments.

### Key Takeaway

Istio's pattern is closest to a mesh attached gateway with an optional centralized egress gateway, where the centralized egress gateway serves as an optional chokepoint in cases where e.g., all traffic exiting a mesh (or node) must adhere to a given policy, or in clusters where application nodes have no public IPs. In their model external destinations are represented via `ServiceEntry` as opposed to something like a `Backend`.

Though notably, the introduction of a "Waypoint Proxy" to centralize policy enforcement for traffic associated with a namespace, including traffic to external services modeled via ServiceEntry, moves Istio's egress model closer to a centralized enforcement boundary.

## Linkerd

Linkerd's model is mesh-attached, with policy enforced at the sidecar proxy. There is no mandatory centralized gateway.

> Linkerd’s egress control is implemented in the sidecar proxy itself; separate egress gateways are not required (though they can be supported).

[source](https://linkerd.io/2-edge/features/egress/)

There is an important caveat regarding egress via service mesh.

> No service mesh can provide a strong security guarantee about egress traffic by itself; for example, a malicious actor could bypass the Linkerd sidecar - and thus Linkerd’s egress controls - entirely. Fully restricting egress traffic in the presence of arbitrary applications thus typically requires a more comprehensive approach.

### EgressNetwork

The key primitive in Linkerd's approach is `EgressNetwork`. It may represent multiple external destinations.

> EgressNetwork can encompass a set of destinations. This set can vary in size - from a single IP address to the entire network space that is not within the boundaries of the cluster.

[source](https://linkerd.io/2-edge/reference/egress-network/#egressnetwork-semantics)

Fundamentally, this means that `EgressNetwork` exists to classify outbound traffic, not to represent a concrete upstream endpoint or its connection semantics. Policy is applied via Gateway API's `HTTPRoute` and `TLSRoute` which attach to the `EgressNetwork` as parent.

In this model, Gateway API resources act purely as a policy expression language, not as a description of deployed gateway infrastructure.

`EgressNetwork` maintains a distinction between namespace and global scoping via a designated global namespace.

> EgressNetworks are namespaced resources, which means that they affect only clients within the namespace that they reside in. The only exception is EgressNetworks created in the global egress namespace: these EgressNetworks affect clients in all namespaces.

### Key Takeaway

Linkerd’s approach attaches Gateway API routes to a first-class object that classifies external destinations, rather than representing concrete upstream endpoints or connection semantics. It does not require a centralized egress proxy, relying instead on sidecar enforcement, while explicitly acknowledging that stronger enforcement may require additional mechanisms.

## Network-Level Approaches

Network-level egress (Cilium `CiliumEgressGatewayPolicy`, OVN-Kubernetes `EgressIP`/`EgressFirewall`/`EgressService`) operates at L3/L4 and is complementary to this proposal's focus on application-layer (L7) policy and routing. These approaches are out of scope and may be explored in a follow-up GEP.
